# ARIMA

ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) is a time series analysis model that uses a combination of autoregressive (AR), differencing (I), and moving average (MA) components to forecast future values of a time series based on its past values. The ARIMA model is a generalization of the simpler ARMA (AutoRegressive Moving Average) model, which assumes that the time series is stationary (i.e., its mean and variance do not change over time).

The AR component of the ARIMA model is a linear regression model that uses the previous values of the time series to predict its future values. The MA component is a weighted average of the past error terms (i.e., the difference between the predicted values and the actual values), which captures the random fluctuations or noise in the time series. The I component is a differencing operation that removes the trend or seasonality in the time series, by subtracting the current value from the previous value.

The parameters of the ARIMA model include the order of the AR component (p), the order of the differencing operation (d), and the order of the MA component (q). These parameters can be estimated using various techniques, such as maximum likelihood estimation or Bayesian inference.

ARIMA models are widely used in time series analysis and forecasting, including applications such as financial forecasting, stock price prediction, demand forecasting, and weather forecasting. However, ARIMA models have some limitations, such as the assumption of linear relationships between the variables, the requirement of stationary time series, and the inability to capture complex nonlinear patterns or dependencies. Therefore, other techniques such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models and other deep learning models may be more suitable for some applications.

# src.cpp

This code loads a time series data, sets the ARIMA model parameters, and predicts the next value in the time series using the `predictNextValue` function. The predicted value is then outputted to the console.

# lib.cpp

This code defines a time series data vector data and specifies the order of the ARIMA model (p = 1, d = 1, q = 1). It then creates an ARIMA model object and fits it to the data using the fit() method. The resulting model coefficients and residuals are printed to the console. Finally, the code predicts the next value of the time series using the predict() method and prints the result. Note that this is a simple example, and more complex models may require additional preprocessing, parameter tuning, and error analysis.
